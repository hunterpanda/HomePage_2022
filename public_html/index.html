        <h1>Oops! This is a default page.</h1>
  <p>
          Apparently, no one has uploaded a new page yet for this site. If you're visiting from a link on
                another site, you may   want to let them know that there's nothing here yet.
        </p>
        <p>
                If this is your site, here are <a href="http://www.ts.vcu.edu/askit/web-tools/web-publishing/">some instructions on how to get
                started</a>. If you've uploaded files but this is still showing up, you may need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>Verify that you uploaded them into the <code>public_html</code> folder of your home directory,</li>
                <li>Verify that you named your home page <code>index.html</code>,</li>
                <li>And verify that you have set the permission for your files to <code>rw-r--r--</code> (or 644 in
                        Unix nerd speak).</li>
        </ul>
</body>
